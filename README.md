# Various schematic parts
This repository contains various kicad schematic subpages that I reclycle often. Instead of redrawing/reassigning/forgetting things and respinning boards again, let me put these into reusable subschematics.

Kicad does not really handle such a system well, these schematics are manually copied in each project and the referred. Converting projects by using subschematics messes up part numbering and makes you redo some layout.
* SWD_connector.sch contains basic ARM Serial Wire debug connector with few series resistors and pullups/downs according to many microcontroller manufacturer specifications.
